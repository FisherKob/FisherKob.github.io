      <description>Explicit is better than implicit; Errors should never pass silently, unless explicitly silenced. I’ve spent the first half of my twenties as a student, analyst and a data scientist. I have travelled across the US except the west which I am aiming to explore in 2022, getting to blogging and an aspiring book worm.
I’m currently thinking about:
 Software Design and Principles Complex data analytical techniques Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies Anonymous internet personas in the age of cancel culture Economics and Stock Market New applications for risk diversification  If you’re also interested in the above topics, have feedback on my writing, or just want to say hello, please get in touch.</description>
