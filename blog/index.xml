      <description>Reinventing The Body, Resurrecting The Soul - Deepak Chopra
The forgotten miracle - Life is meant to be a complete experience. People keep struggling with problems both physical and mental, never suspecting the root: that the bond between body and soul has been severed.
  Reinventing your body: You, right at this minute, stand at the growing tip of evolution. The next thing you think, the next action you take, will either create a new possibility for you or it will repeat the past.</description>

      <description>Kobe Bryant, one of the greatest basketball players of all time, is my huge source of inspiration.
I wasn&amp;rsquo;t very involved in basketball until I moved to the US. I first played basketball with a few friends when I was in college and I loved it so much that it quickly became my favorite sport. As a result, I became more immersed in the sport by watching the NBA games and generally learning more about them.</description>

      <description>Note: For those unfamiliar with the issue, this article involves a discussion about recent criticism of Chamath&amp;rsquo;s seemingly nonchalant stance on Chinese treatment of the Uyghurs Community. For more context, checkout: BBC&amp;rsquo;s article.
Recently, Chamath&amp;rsquo;s (CEO of Social Capital) notoriously dismissive remarks on the Uyghurs community made at All-in podcast had drawn quite a lot of mainstream media backlash which led me to ruminate on where I stand on the human rights issues and how as a society we should go about tackling this problem.</description>
